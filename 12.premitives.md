# These primitives are signature objects themselves, 
# so they can be combined in any number of ways to compose complex work-flows.


# 1.group
# 2.map
# 3.chain
# 4.chord
# 5.starmap
# 6.chunks


# Groups: 
A group calls a list of tasks in parallel, 
and it returns a special result instance that lets you inspect the results as a group, 
and retrieve the return values in order.

 from celery import group
>>> from proj.tasks import add

>>> group(add.s(i, i) for i in range(10))().get()
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]


## Partial group:
>>> g = group(add.s(i) for i in range(10))
>>> g(10).get()
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]




# Chains

    >>> from celery import chain
    >>> from proj.tasks import add, mul

    # (4 + 4) * 8
    >>> chain(add.s(4, 4) | mul.s(8))().get()


## partial chain:
    >>> # (? + 4) * 8
    >>> g = chain(add.s(4) | mul.s(8))
    >>> g(4).get()

Chains can also be written like this:

>>> (add.s(4, 4) | mul.s(8))().get()

# Chords
A chord is a group with a callback:

>>> from celery import chord
>>> from proj.tasks import add, xsum

>>> chord((add.s(i, i) for i in range(10)), xsum.s())().get()

A group chained to another task will be automatically converted to a chord:
