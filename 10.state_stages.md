STARTED :started state is a special state that’s only recorded if the task_track_started setting is enabled, or if the @task(track_started=True) option is set for the task.

PENDING - Not a recorded state, but rather the default state for any task id that’s unknown: this you can see from this 


Task stages for a task that had failed once.
